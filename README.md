# 🎮 Unity Essentials Project

This is my **Unity Essentials Project**, built while completing the [Unity Essentials Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-essentials).  
It demonstrates the fundamentals of Unity game development — including scenes, game objects, components, physics, UI, and simple interactions.
